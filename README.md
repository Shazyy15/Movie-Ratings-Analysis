## üìä Project Overview

The **Movie Ratings Analysis** project is designed to help you explore patterns in movie data and understand how different attributes relate to ratings and revenue. The analysis includes:

- **Ratings Distribution**: How movie ratings are spread across various ranges.
- **Revenue by Genre**: Revenue comparisons among different genres.
- **Votes vs. Ratings**: Understanding how ratings correlate with the number of votes.
- **Revenue by Year and Genre**: Tracking revenue over time, broken down by genre.
- **Average Ratings Over Time**: A trend line illustrating how ratings have evolved over the years.

### Key Features:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Discover how features like budget and votes relate to ratings.
- **Distribution Insights**: Visualize how ratings are distributed and where they cluster.
- **Revenue Patterns**: Uncover revenue trends by genre and over time.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Each chart is designed with unique features for readability and insight.
